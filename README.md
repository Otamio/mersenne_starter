# mersenne_starter
# Name: Jiang Wang

### Description
The folder contains the following files:
1. README.md, the description file for the project
2. mersenne.c, the C implementation for the project (sligtly modified on the files). Instead of starting with 2, p (in the main function) now starts with 3, since the LLT algorithm does not work with p=2.
3. Makefile for the mersenne.c code.
4. MIPS implementation (mersenne.asm).
5. QtSPIM terminal output (output.txt).
6. "assembly" folder, where each file in the folder contains one or more functions (for unit testing).

All functions are fully implemented in the asm file. Lots of documentation are added to the source file.
